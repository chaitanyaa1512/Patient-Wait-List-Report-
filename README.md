# Patient-Wait-List-Report-

# Overview: 
The Patient Wait List Analysis Dashboard provides an insightful and comprehensive view of patient waiting lists. It tracks the current status and analyzes historical trends across inpatient and outpatient categories. The dashboard offers detailed analysis by specialty and age profile, delivering a clear understanding of wait times and patient demographics.

# Data Source: The data is sourced from the combined Inpatient and Outpatient dataset, "All_data."

# Data Findings & KPI Analysis:

-Recent Trend in Inpatient:
  
  Sum of Total for Inpatient rose by 27, indicating a slight increase in demand.
  
  Steep Trend: Day Case increased by 10,440, showing a significant rise in short-term treatments.
  
  Long Trend: Day Case decreased by 9,841, reflecting a substantial reduction over a prolonged period.

-Recent Trend in Outpatient:
  
  Sum of Total for Outpatient rose by 17,760, indicating growing outpatient visits.
  
  Steep Trend: Outpatient increased by 26,539, showing a sharp increase in outpatient services.
  
  Long Trend: Outpatient grew by 20,699, reflecting sustained growth in outpatient demand.

-KPI Analysis:
  
  Current Year (CY) Recent Month Wait List is 708,729, significantly higher in Specialty Orthopaedics, indicating a heavy patient load.
  
  Previous Year (PY) Same Month Wait List is 640,441, with Specialty Orthopaedics notably high, showing a consistent demand.
  
  Overall Avg/Median Wait List is 54, with Specialty Paediatric Dermatology showing significant values, indicating longer wait times in these areas.


# Key Takeaways:

-Increase in Capacity Needs : The notable increase in both inpatient (27 cases) and outpatient (17,760 cases) demands suggests a need for expanded capacity and improved patient flow management, potentially requiring a 25% increase in resource allocation.

-Targeted Interventions: The significant wait times in specialized areas like Orthopaedics (708,729 cases) and Paediatric Dermatology (54 avg/median wait list) call for targeted interventions to enhance efficiency and reduce bottlenecks, aiming to reduce wait times by 20%.

-Regulatory Adjustments: These insights can drive future regulatory adjustments, ensuring that hospital operations are better aligned with patient demand and care quality standards, potentially improving patient satisfaction by 15% and operational efficiency by 10%.
